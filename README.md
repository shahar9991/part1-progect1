## How To Compile And Run The Code:


## Our Work Process:
First, we read toghether the assignment and identified the tasks that need to be done. We used Jira to manage the tasks.
We started with writing tests for the basic functions of the project, such as getting input from the user.
Then we implemented the functions in a simple way so that they pass the tests.
We built the logical flow of the project (classes and functions) and when the code passed all the tests we refactored it. 


### The Refactors We Did
+ We implemented the command design pattern. We created an interface called IExecutable which has a function "execute" and two classes that implement it: AddURL and IsBlacklisted. 
these two classes have a bloom filter as a member, and this bloom filter object stores the data structure of the filter and the hash functions.

+ We implemented the SOLID principles.
